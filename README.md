# Hybrid_Power
Under a “hybrid” multisite impact evaluation design, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are conducted in some study sites (where feasible) and quasi-experimental designs (QEDs) are conducted in more sites, including the RCT sites. This design can increase precision and generalizability and can be used to test and adjust for hidden bias in the QED-only sites. Hybrid_Power is a Shiny R dashboard that performs power calculations for such hybrid designs using the methods discussed in Schochet (Reference, 2026). The methods allow for potential hidden biases in the QED impacts after incorporating inverse probability weighting, which can be measured in the RCT-QED sites conditional on covariates and then transported to the QED-only sites. The approach fuses causal inference and machine learning estimation methods, with multiple applications of the classification and regression trees (CART) algorithm. The power calculations are conducted for commonly used designs—including nonclustered and clustered designs—and allow for model covariates to improve precision. The inputs for the power analysis can be entered flexibly into the dashboard.
